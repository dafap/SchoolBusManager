### Fixed

- [#13](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-tag/pull/13) updates the
  zend-stdlib dependency to `^2.7 || ^3.0`, instead of just `^3.0`, allowing
  it to work with users of zf2 v2 versions. Since the functionality consumed is
  present and unchanged in both versions, this is a safe constraint.

  to be forward-compatible with zend-servicemanager v3.
