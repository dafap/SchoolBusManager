## 2.7.0 - 2018-05-01

### Added

- [#23](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-permissions-acl/pull/23) adds a new assertion, `ExpressionAssertion`, to allow programatically or
  automatically (from configuration) building standard comparison assertions
  using a variety of operators, including `=` (`==`), `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`,
  `>=`, `===`, `!==`, `in` (`in_array`), `!in` (`! in_array`), `regex`
  (`preg_match`), and `!regex` (`! preg_match`). See https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-permissions-acl/expression/
  for details on usage.

- [#3](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-permissions-acl/pull/3) adds two new interfaces designed to allow creation of ownership-based assertions
  easier:

  - `Zend\Permissions\Acl\ProprietaryInterface` is applicable to both roles and
    resources, and provides the method `getOwnerId()` for retrieving the owner
    role of an object.

  - `Zend\Permissions\Acl\Assertion\OwnershipAssertion` ensures that the owner
    of a proprietary resource matches that of the role.

  See https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-permissions-acl/ownership/ for details
  on usage.
