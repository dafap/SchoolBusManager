## 2.5.2 - 2015-11-23

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- **ZF2015-09**: `Zend\Captcha\Word` generates a "word" for a CAPTCHA challenge
  by selecting a sequence of random letters from a character set. Prior to this
  vulnerability announcement, the selection was performed using PHP's internal
  `array_rand()` function. This function does not generate sufficient entropy
  due to its usage of `rand()` instead of more cryptographically secure methods
  such as `openssl_pseudo_random_bytes()`. This could potentially lead to
  information disclosure should an attacker be able to brute force the random
  number generation. This release contains a patch that replaces the
  `array_rand()` calls to use `Zend\Math\Rand::getInteger()`, which provides
  better RNG.

## 2.4.9 - 2015-11-23
