### Fixed

- [#25](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/25) changes the
  `doctrine/common` suggestion/dev-dependency to the more specific
  `doctrine/annotations` package (which is what is actually consumed).

## 2.6.0 - 2015-11-18

### Added

- [#12](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/12) adds the ability to
  generate arrays using either long/standard syntax (`array(...)`) or short
  syntax (`[...]`). This can be accomplished by setting the value type to
  `ValueGenerator::TYPE_ARRAY_SHORT` instead of using `TYPE_ARRAY`.
  Additionally, you can use `TYPE_ARRAY_LONG` instead of `TYPE_ARRAY`; the two
  constants are synonyms.
- [#11](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/11) adds the ability to
  generate interfaces via the new class `Zend\Code\Generator\InterfaceGenerator`.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#20](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/20) updates
  the zend-eventmanager dependency to `^2.6|^3.0`, and changes its
  internal usage to use the `triggerEventUntil()` signature.

## 2.5.3 - 2015-11-18

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- [#10](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/10) removes a
  development dependency on zendframework/zend-version.
- [#23](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/23) removes a
  requirement on zendframework/zend-stdlib. This results in a slight change in
  `Zend\Code\Generator\ValueGenerator`: `setConstants()` and `getConstants()`
  can now receive/emit *either* an SPL `ArrayObject` or
  `Zend\Stdlib\ArrayObject`. Since these are functionally equivalent, however,
  you will experience no change in behavior.

### Fixed

- Nothing.
