From its home page, XML-RPC is described as a ”...remote procedure calling using
HTTP as the transport and XML as the encoding. XML-RPC is designed to be as
simple as possible, while allowing complex data structures to be transmitted,
processed and returned.”

`Zend\XmlRpc` provides support for both consuming remote XML-RPC services and
building new XML-RPC servers.
